## My process

I built it using the mobile first development approach applying the required styling for small devices and moved toward adding more complexity for desktop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Mobile Simulator for real device simulation.

### What I learned

I learned about button hover effects, rem scaling and it was my first time using mobile first workflow.

### Continued development

I am still learning about button styling, a little tricky for me. Next time I would love to add some shadow animation for whole card if using in a larger project.
